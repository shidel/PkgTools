; Below whenever a $ is used, it represents a variable or string that will be
; inserted replacing the $ in the translation. These are not variables like
; $NLS, the $ will be replaced and NLS will remain. The exception to this
; rule is when $ is followed by a number. For example, $0, $1, etc. In those
; very rare cases, there are multiple strings that will be replaced.
